# Customer Sats

`example project.R` is an example of a script used to automatically generate customer satisfaction ratings from survey data, which were tested for significant differences month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter, then formatted to easily copy into Excel workbooks.  Identifying details have been removed.

Much of the code between various scripts was identical, and so shared code was moved into the `griftools` library as four callable functions.
